## Human evaluation rubric (W4)

### Scales (1–5)
- 1 = poor / fails requirement
- 3 = acceptable
- 5 = excellent

### Criteria
**Coherence**
- Story/quest is logically consistent and readable.

**Creativity**
- Originality, surprising ideas, engaging content.

**Faithfulness**
- Response follows the prompt and respects constraints.

**Overall**
- General quality and usefulness as a quest output.

### Instructions
1) Compare baseline vs tuned for the same prompt.
2) Score each response separately (or the better one in notes).
3) Add short notes about strengths/weaknesses.

### Data volume note
Human evaluation is more reliable with many scored prompts. Aim for dozens to
hundreds of rows, and if possible multiple evaluators to reduce bias.
