"One night, two brave animals were walking through a dark forest. The first animal was a big, strong bear. The second animal was a small, alert owl. The owl said, ""The trees are so dark here. I can barely see!"" The bear said, ""Don't be scared, little owl. I'm here with you."" The owl said, ""Thank you, bear. I feel safer with you here."" Suddenly, they heard a loud noise.
