"Once upon a time, there was a girl named Ali. She was just 3 years old. One day, Ali and her mum went to the shops. Ali wanted a new jacket. She looked at lots of jackets and found one she liked. It was a regular jacket and it had lots of colourful flowers and stars. So Ali's mummy set the jacket on the counter and paid for it. She wrapped it up in a special bag and took it home. When they got back home, Ali took her new jacket out of the bag. She put the jacket on and it felt so lovely and warm. Ali was so happy and loved her new jacket. From then on, Ali wore her regular jacket all the time, even when it was sunny outside. Everywhere she went, Ali felt cosy and comfortable in her new jacket.","Once upon a time, there was a girl named Ali. She was just 3 years old. One day, Ali and her mum went to the shops.
